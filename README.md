# Lunar-Client-QT-Cosmetics-Agent
Free Cosmetics & Emotes agent for Lunar Client QT (Youded-byte's Fork)

# Required
[Youded-byte's Fork and Edited version of Lunar Client QT](https://github.com/Youded-byte/lunar-client-qt) is required.

# How to use
1) Put the "LunarCosmetics.jar" file in the "agents (DON'T TOUCH)" folder.
2) In LCQT under agents tab, add "LunarCosmetics.jar" and enable it.
3) Then Launch the game.

# Incompatibilities
1) Incompatible with: "LunarPacksFix" agent.
2) Lunar Cosmetics DOESN'T WORK with cracked accounts due to how lunar client's api works. This also applies to Premium Accounts playing on cracked servers. (This is also the case if you actually own the cosmetics).

# Later Lunar Updates
Later Lunar Client updates may break the "Lunar Cosmetics" Agent, if that happens, check https://discord.gg/vFn4Va9B8G and download that version (.jar file), then put it in %userprofile%/.lunarclient/offline/multiver.
